## Project Overview
- **About Me**: Introduces my background, where I am from, and my early interest in technology.  
- **Developer Identity**: Explains my current goals in the tech industry and how I am building skills for the future.  
- **Learning Journey**: Reflects on how I started learning coding later, what Iâ€™ve learned so far, and what I want to explore next.  

## Technologies Used

- Git and GitHub for version control  
- GitHub Pages for deployment  

## AI and Research Tools
Some of the content in this project was assisted by AI tools (ChatGPT) for brainstorming and drafting. All content was revised and adapted to reflect my own voice and information.
