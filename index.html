    <!-- About Me Section -->
    <section id="about-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Nirajan Singh Thakuri, and I am from Nepal. I grew up in a simple and supportive environment with a normal childhood. From a young age, I found myself drawn to technology and anything related to computers, gadgets, and how things work. This interest was not something forced but something that developed naturally over the years as I explored new tools and devices around me.</p>
      <p>Although my upbringing was ordinary, my curiosity about the digital world stayed constant. I often liked to watch how people used technology to solve problems and create new things. That curiosity eventually influenced my decision to study IT and start building a foundation for my future career in technology. Nepal gave me a strong sense of community, and that background still motivates me to do meaningful work in the future.</p>
      <p>Outside of my studies, I enjoy learning new skills and exploring ideas that connect people and technology. Even though I have not had a very unusual life, my steady interest in tech has been a defining part of who I am and what I want to do next.</p>

    <!-- Developer Identity Section -->
    <section id="developer-identity">
      <h2>Developer Identity</h2>
      <p>I see myself as someone who is steadily preparing for a career in the technology industry. I am not yet a professional developer, but I am working to build the knowledge and skills I will need. My focus is on learning the basics well so that I can grow into more advanced areas of development later. This includes understanding programming concepts, web development, and how modern tools and workflows function together.</p>
      <p>Right now, I am learning through coursework, practice assignments, and small projects. Each task is a chance to improve my problem-solving ability and get comfortable with tools used in the real world. I do not claim to be an expert, but I see myself as a future web professional who is serious about building a solid base for a long-term career in tech. This approach helps me stay patient and realistic while still being motivated to improve.</p>
      <p>Over time, I hope to combine my interest in technology with real-world skills that make me employable and effective. My developer identity is still forming, but it is grounded in steady progress and a desire to contribute to meaningful work.</p>

    <!-- Learning Journey Section -->
    <section id="learning-journey">
      <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
      <p>I started learning about coding and technology a little later than I had originally planned. While some people begin very early, my journey began more slowly, but I have already learned a few programming languages and concepts. This has given me a basic understanding of how software works and how websites are built, and each step has made me more confident about moving forward.</p>
      <p>Although I am still in the early stages of my learning, I appreciate every opportunity to practice and improve. I know that learning to code takes time and patience, so I am focused on steady growth rather than rushing. My current goal is to expand my skills to include more programming languages, frameworks, and tools that will prepare me for the challenges of a real development job.</p>
      <p>In the future, I want to continue exploring new areas of technology and find the fields that interest me most. This might include building web applications, learning about data, or understanding how systems work behind the scenes. I am motivated to keep learning and to use this knowledge to build a career in technology that reflects both my personal interests and professional goals.</p>
